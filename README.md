# Mathematics

This project has code for finite field arithmetic and linear algebra over these fields.  In helper, there is a class for using floating-point numbers, showing the required methods such a field should implement. Notice that the code might have some issues, especially when we use a field with a characteristic different from two. The RealFeal class was implemented only for testing purposes and hasn't been used for anything beyond that.
